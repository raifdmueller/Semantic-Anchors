== What are Semantic Anchors?

*Semantic anchors* are well-defined terms, methodologies, and frameworks that serve as reference points when communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs). They act as shared vocabulary that triggers specific, contextually rich knowledge domains within an LLM's training data.

*Example:* Instead of explaining "write tests before code, use mocks, design from outside-in," you can simply say *"TDD, London School"* and the LLM activates its entire knowledge about that methodology.

=== Why Use Them?

[horizontal]
🎯 *Precision*:: Reduce ambiguity by referencing established bodies of knowledge
⚡ *Efficiency*:: Convey rich context with minimal tokens
🔄 *Consistency*:: Ensure LLMs interpret concepts as intended
🧠 *Depth*:: Activate multiple interconnected concepts with a single term

== Quality Criteria

A good semantic anchor is:

* *Precise*: References a specific, established body of knowledge
* *Rich*: Activates multiple interconnected concepts
* *Consistent*: Different users get similar conceptual activation
* *Attributable*: Can be traced to key proponents or publications

== Contributing

We welcome proposals for new semantic anchors! Our automated workflow with GitHub Copilot makes contributing easy:

1. Click link:https://github.com/LLM-Coding/Semantic-Anchors/issues/new?template=propose-anchor.yml[Propose New Anchor]
2. Provide the term and optional context
3. Copilot validates against quality criteria
4. If accepted, Copilot enriches and creates the anchor
5. Maintainers review and merge the PR
