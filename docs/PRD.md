# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Semantic Anchors for LLMs - Website & Repository Redesign

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** Implemented

---

## Executive Summary

The Semantic Anchors repository has grown from a simple README to a comprehensive catalog of 60+ semantic anchors across 10 categories. To better serve its growing user base and enable easier contributions, the project requires:

1. **Website**: A modern, bilingual (EN/DE), responsive website with dark/light mode
2. **Visualization**: Card grid with category sections showing MECE-compliant categories and role-based filtering (originally planned as treemap, changed per ADR-005)
3. **Repository Structure**: Modular AsciiDoc files replacing the monolithic README
4. **Contribution Workflow**: Automated issue templates and GitHub Actions/Copilot integration for proposing and adding new anchors

---

## Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Improve Discoverability**: Make semantic anchors easier to find through visualization and role-based filtering
2. **Lower Contribution Barrier**: Enable non-technical users to propose new anchors via structured issues
3. **Ensure Quality**: Automate validation that proposed terms meet semantic anchor criteria (precise, rich, consistent, attributable)
4. **Scale Content**: Support growth beyond 100+ anchors through modular structure

### Success Metrics
- Increase in contributions (issues, PRs) by 50% within 3 months
- Reduce time-to-merge for new anchors from manual review to semi-automated workflow
- Website traffic and user engagement (time on site, pages viewed)
- International reach (EN/DE usage split)

---

## User Personas

## Open Questions

1. **AsciiDoc Metadata**: Should metadata be embedded in AsciiDoc frontmatter or separate YAML files?
   - **Recommendation**: Separate YAML for easier programmatic access

2. **Anchor Granularity**: One file per anchor or one file per category?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with one file per category, split to individual files if needed for scalability

3. **Visualization Library**: D3.js / Apache ECharts treemap was originally planned (ADR-003), but replaced by CSS Grid card grid (ADR-005) due to text truncation, contrast issues, and viewport problems.
   - **Decision**: CSS Grid card grid (no external library needed)

4. **Translation Approach**: Human translation or machine translation with review?
   - **Recommendation**: Human translation for quality, start with UI elements, anchor content can remain EN-only initially

5. **MECE Category Validation**: Should we run formal MECE analysis workshop or asynchronous review?
   - **Recommendation**: Asynchronous review with documentation of overlaps and gaps
