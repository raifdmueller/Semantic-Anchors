== What are Semantic Anchors?

*Semantic anchors* are well-defined terms, methodologies, and frameworks that serve as reference points when communicating with Large Language Models (LLMs). They act as shared vocabulary that triggers specific, contextually rich knowledge domains within an LLM's training data.

Think of them as *shortcuts to rich context* - instead of explaining a complex methodology from scratch, you can invoke a semantic anchor and the LLM will activate its entire knowledge base about that concept.

=== Example

Instead of saying:
[quote]
____
"Write tests before writing code, use mocks to isolate dependencies, and design from the outside in."
____

You can say:
[quote]
____
"Use *TDD, London School* approach."
____

The LLM understands this activates:

* Mock-heavy testing methodology
* Outside-in development approach
* Interaction-based verification
* The teachings of Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce
* Designing through collaboration tests first

== Why Use Semantic Anchors?

=== 🎯 Precision
Semantic anchors provide *unambiguous communication*. When you reference "SOLID Principles," both you and the LLM understand exactly which five principles you mean.

=== 🧠 Depth
A single semantic anchor can activate *dozens of related concepts*. "Domain-Driven Design" brings in bounded contexts, ubiquitous language, aggregates, value objects, and much more.

=== ⚡ Efficiency
Instead of writing lengthy explanations, you can *reference established methodologies* that the LLM already knows deeply.

=== 🔄 Consistency
Different people using the same semantic anchor will get *similar, predictable results* from the LLM, because the anchor refers to well-documented concepts.

== Quality Criteria

Not every term makes a good semantic anchor. We maintain high quality standards:

=== Precise
References a *specific, established body of knowledge* with clear boundaries.

✅ "Hexagonal Architecture" (specific architectural pattern)

❌ "Good architecture" (vague, subjective)

=== Rich
Activates *multiple interconnected concepts*, not just a single instruction.

✅ "Behavior-Driven Development" (scenarios, Gherkin, living documentation, outside-in)

❌ "Write tests" (single instruction, no depth)

=== Consistent
Different users invoking it get *similar conceptual activation*.

✅ "Test-Driven Development" (widely documented, consistent understanding)

❌ "Modern testing" (different interpretations)

=== Attributable
Can be *traced to key proponents, publications, or documented standards*.

✅ "arc42" (Gernot Starke, Peter Hruschka)

❌ "Best practices" (no specific source)

== What is NOT a Semantic Anchor?

Not every well-known term qualifies as a semantic anchor. Understanding what *doesn't* work helps clarify what does.

=== Common Counter-Examples

These terms are frequently used but *lack the depth and definition* required for semantic anchors:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|❌ Not a Semantic Anchor |Why Not?

|*"TLDR"*
|Underspecified instruction with no defined structure or methodology. Just means "be brief" without any framework for how.

|*"ELI5"* (Explain Like I'm 5)
|Vague target level with no pedagogical framework. What does "5-year-old level" mean technically? No consistent interpretation.

|*"Keep it short"*
|Pure directive with no conceptual depth. It's an instruction, not a methodology.

|*"Best practices"*
|Too vague and not attributable. Whose best practices? Based on what research or authority?

|*"Modern approach"*
|Ambiguous and inconsistent. "Modern" means different things to different people and changes over time.

|*"Make it simple"*
|No reference to specific simplification frameworks (unlike KISS principle or Occam's Razor which *are* semantic anchors).

=== Comparison: Good vs. Bad

[%collapsible]
====
*Example 1: Testing Instructions*

❌ *Bad*: "Write good tests"
[horizontal]
Problem:: Vague instruction, no methodology
Result:: Inconsistent interpretations

✅ *Good*: "Test-Driven Development, London School"
[horizontal]
Activates:: Mock-heavy testing, outside-in design, interaction-based verification
Proponents:: Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce
Result:: Consistent, rich implementation

---

*Example 2: Communication Style*

❌ *Bad*: "Keep it short"
[horizontal]
Problem:: No structure, just a preference
Result:: Arbitrary length decisions

✅ *Good*: "Pyramid Principle"
[horizontal]
Activates:: Start with conclusion, group ideas, logical ordering
Proponent:: Barbara Minto
Result:: Structured, repeatable communication pattern

---

*Example 3: Code Quality*

❌ *Bad*: "Best practices"
[horizontal]
Problem:: Not attributable, no specific practices
Result:: Everyone has different "best practices"

✅ *Good*: "SOLID Principles"
[horizontal]
Activates:: Five specific design principles (SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP)
Proponents:: Robert C. Martin
Result:: Concrete, testable guidelines
====

=== The Key Difference

[sidebar]
****
*Semantic Anchors* activate **rich, interconnected knowledge domains** from the LLM's training data.

*Simple Instructions* just tell the LLM **what to do**, without providing conceptual framework or methodology.
****

Think of semantic anchors as *nouns* (methodologies, frameworks, principles) rather than *verbs* (instructions, directives).

=== Testing a Potential Anchor

Before proposing a new semantic anchor, ask an LLM:

[source]
----
What concepts do you associate with '<your term>'?
----

If the response includes:

* ✅ Multiple interconnected concepts
* ✅ Key proponents or publications
* ✅ Specific techniques or practices
* ✅ Clear scope and boundaries

→ It's likely a good semantic anchor!

If the response is:

* ❌ Just a simple definition
* ❌ No attributed source
* ❌ Vague or inconsistent interpretations
* ❌ Just instructions without depth

→ It's probably not a semantic anchor.

== Using Semantic Anchors with LLMs

=== In Prompts

Reference semantic anchors directly in your prompts:

[source]
----
"Refactor this code following SOLID Principles."

"Design this API using RESTful constraints as defined by Roy Fielding."

"Write these scenarios in Gherkin format per Behavior-Driven Development."
----

=== In Context Setup

Set up your LLM conversation with semantic anchors:

[source]
----
I'm working on a project where we follow:
- Test-Driven Development (TDD, Chicago School)
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design
- SOLID Principles

Please keep these in mind when suggesting code changes.
----

=== In Code Reviews

Ask the LLM to review code against specific methodologies:

[source]
----
Review this code for violations of:
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle
- Law of Demeter
----

=== Testing Recognition

Before relying on a semantic anchor, test if the LLM recognizes it:

[source]
----
What concepts do you associate with 'MECE'?
----

If the LLM provides accurate, detailed information, it's safe to use that anchor.
