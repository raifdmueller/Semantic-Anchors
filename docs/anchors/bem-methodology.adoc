*Full Name*: Block Element Modifier (BEM) (S)CSS Methodology

*Core Concepts*:

* *Motivation*: Solve CSS specificity wars, naming conflicts, and stylesheet maintainability issues in large codebases
* *Block*: Standalone component that is meaningful on its own (e.g., `menu`, `button`, `header`)
* *Element*: Part of a block with no standalone meaning (e.g., `menu__item`, `button__icon`)
* *Modifier*: Flag on blocks or elements that changes appearance or behavior (e.g., `button--disabled`, `menu__item--active`)
* *Naming convention*: `block__element--modifier` structure
* *Independence*: Blocks are self-contained and reusable
* *No cascading*: Avoid deep CSS selectors, use flat structure
* *Explicit relationships*: Clear parent-child relationships through naming
* *Reusability*: Components can be moved anywhere in the project
* *Mix*: Combining multiple BEM entities on a single DOM node
* *File structure*: Often paired with component-based file organization

*Naming Examples*:

* Block: `.search-form`
* Element: `.search-form__input`, `.search-form__button`
* Modifier: `.search-form--compact`, `.search-form__button--disabled`

*Key Proponents*: Yandex development team

*When to Use*:

* Large-scale web applications with many components
* Team projects requiring consistent (S)CSS naming conventions
* When (S)CSS maintainability and scalability are priorities
* Projects where developers need to quickly understand (S)CSS structure
* Component-based architectures (React, Vue, Angular)
