*Full Name*: BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

*Also known as*: Direct Answer Format, Conclusion-First Communication

*Core Concepts*:

* *Conclusion First*: State the main point, decision, or recommendation immediately
* *Inverted Pyramid*: Most important information first, supporting details follow
* *Action Orientation*: Lead with what needs to happen or what was decided
* *Busy Reader Optimization*: Enable time-pressed readers to get key information instantly
* *Supporting Evidence Follows*: Detailed rationale, data, and background come after the conclusion
* *Scannable Structure*: Clear hierarchy enables readers to stop at their needed depth
* *Clarity Over Suspense*: No narrative buildup or delayed conclusions
* *One Sentence First*: Ideally, the BLUF itself is a single, clear sentence

*Key Proponents*: US Military (Army writing standards), adopted broadly in business and government

*Historical Context*: Standardized in military communication where rapid decision-making is critical; now standard in business writing (McKinsey, consulting, executive communication)

*When to Use*:

* Executive summaries and briefings
* Status reports to leadership
* Email to busy stakeholders
* Incident reports requiring immediate action
* Any high-stakes communication where the reader needs the conclusion first
* Technical documentation for time-constrained readers

*Relationship to Other Anchors*:

* Related to <<pyramid-principle,Pyramid Principle>> but more narrowly focused on conclusion-first structure
* Complements MECE by providing the organizational principle for grouped information
* Contrasts with narrative or exploratory writing styles

*Counter-example*: Academic papers (which build to conclusions) or storytelling (which uses suspense)
