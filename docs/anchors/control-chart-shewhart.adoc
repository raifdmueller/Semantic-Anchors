Full Name:: Shewhart Control Chart

Also known as:: Process Control Chart, SPC Chart

*Core Concepts*:

Time series diagram:: Measured value plotted over time

Centerline (CL):: Process mean

Upper/Lower Control Limit (UCL/LCL):: Typically at ±3σ from the mean

Zones A/B/C:: Division into 6 areas (each 1σ wide) for pattern recognition

Common Cause Variation:: Inherent, random fluctuation of a stable process

Special Cause Variation:: Assignable, correctable deviation

Chart Types::
* X-bar Chart: Subgroup means
* R-Chart: Subgroup ranges
* I-MR Chart: Individual values and moving range
* p-Chart: Defect proportions
* c-Chart: Defect counts per unit

In-Control vs. Out-of-Control:: Core decision based on rules (Nelson, Western Electric)

Normal distribution assumption:: Control limits are based on normally distributed data


Key Proponent:: Walter A. Shewhart (1920s, Bell Labs / Western Electric)

Key Work:: "Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product" (1931)

*Relationship to Other Anchors*:

Nelson Rules:: 8 rules for pattern recognition on Control Charts

<<spc,SPC>>:: Control Charts are the central tool of Statistical Process Control

Six Sigma:: Control Charts are used in the Control phase of DMAIC


*When to Use*:

* Process monitoring in manufacturing and production
* Quality assurance using statistical methods
* Detection of process shifts and trends
* Foundation for rule-based anomaly detection in time series
* Conceptual basis — even when different terminology is used in IT monitoring
