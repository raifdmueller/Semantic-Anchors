Full Name:: Domain-Driven Design according to Eric Evans

*Core Concepts*:

Ubiquitous Language:: Shared vocabulary between developers and domain experts

Bounded Context:: Explicit boundaries where a model is defined and applicable

Aggregates:: Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit

Entities:: Objects defined by identity, not attributes

Value Objects:: Immutable objects defined by their attributes

Repositories:: Abstraction for object persistence and retrieval

Domain Events:: Significant occurrences in the domain

Strategic Design:: Context mapping, anti-corruption layers

Tactical Design:: Building blocks (entities, value objects, services)

Model-Driven Design:: Code that expresses the domain model


Key Proponent:: Eric Evans ("Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software", 2003)

*When to Use*:

* Complex business domains with intricate rules
* Long-lived systems requiring deep domain understanding
* When business and technical teams need close collaboration
* Systems where the domain logic is the core value
