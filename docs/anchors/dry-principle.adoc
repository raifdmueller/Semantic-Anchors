*Full Name*: Don't Repeat Yourself Principle

*Core Concepts*:

* *Single representation*: Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous representation
* *Avoid duplication*: Eliminate duplicate code, logic, and knowledge across the system
* *Abstraction*: Extract common patterns into reusable components
* *Maintenance efficiency*: Changes require modification in only one place
* *Knowledge duplication vs. code duplication*: Focus on avoiding duplicate knowledge, not just duplicate code
* *Normalized data*: Apply DRY to data structures and schemas
* *Configuration management*: Centralize configuration and avoid scattered settings

*Key Proponent*: Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas ("The Pragmatic Programmer", 1999)

*When to Use*:

* Refactoring codebases with repeated logic or patterns
* Designing APIs and libraries to minimize client code duplication
* Creating maintainable systems where changes are frequent
* Establishing coding standards and best practices

*Related Concepts*: SPOT, SSOT, WET (Write Everything Twice - deliberate exception to DRY)
