Full Name:: Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax

*Core Concepts*:

Ubiquitous requirements:: "The <system> shall <requirement>"

Event-driven requirements:: "WHEN <trigger> the <system> shall <requirement>"

Unwanted behavior:: "IF <condition>, THEN the <system> shall <requirement>"

State-driven requirements:: "WHILE <state>, the <system> shall <requirement>"

Optional features:: "WHERE <feature is included>, the <system> shall <requirement>"

Structured syntax:: Consistent templates for clarity

Testability:: Requirements written to be verifiable


Key Proponent:: Alistair Mavin (Rolls-Royce)

*When to Use*:

* Safety-critical systems
* Regulated industries (aerospace, automotive, medical)
* When requirements traceability is essential
* Large, distributed teams
