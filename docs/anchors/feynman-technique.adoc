*Full Name*: Feynman Technique (also Feynman Learning Method)

*Core Concepts*:

* *Explain Simply*: Teach the concept in simple language as if to a beginner (traditionally "explain to a 12-year-old")
* *Identify Gaps*: When you struggle to explain, you've found gaps in your understanding
* *Return to Source Material*: Go back and re-learn the parts you couldn't explain clearly
* *Simplify and Use Analogies*: Refine explanation using plain language and concrete examples
* *Iterative Refinement*: Repeat the cycle until you can explain clearly and simply
* *No Jargon Hiding*: Inability to avoid jargon signals lack of true understanding
* *Active Learning*: Transform passive reading into active teaching
* *Metacognition*: Become aware of what you don't know

*Key Attribution*: Richard Feynman (Nobel Prize-winning physicist, 1965), famous for making complex physics accessible

*Historical Context*: Feynman was renowned for his teaching ability and his belief that deep understanding meant being able to explain simply. The "technique" is a formalization of his learning approach.

*When to Use*:

* Learning new technical concepts or frameworks
* Validating your understanding before using knowledge in practice
* Preparing to teach or present a topic
* Debugging conceptual confusion
* Code review where you explain your design choices simply
* Documentation writing (if you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it)

*Four Steps (Canonical Form)*:

1. *Choose a concept*: Pick the topic you want to understand
2. *Teach it to a child*: Write an explanation in simple terms
3. *Identify gaps and review*: Where you struggle, study more
4. *Simplify and analogize*: Refine your explanation, use examples

*Related Concepts*:

* <<rubber-duck-debugging,Rubber Duck Debugging>> (explaining to understand)
* Learning by teaching
* Active recall
* Elaborative interrogation
* Plain language movement

*Quote*: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." (Often attributed to Einstein, but embodies Feynman's philosophy)
