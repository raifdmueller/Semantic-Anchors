*Full Name*: Five Whys Root Cause Analysis

*Core Concepts*:

* *Iterative Causal Analysis*: Ask "Why?" repeatedly (typically ~5 times) to drill down to root causes
* *Root Cause vs. Symptom*: Distinguish between surface symptoms and underlying causes
* *Causal Chain*: Each answer becomes the subject of the next "Why?" question
* *Actionable Root Cause*: Continue until you reach a cause that can be acted upon
* *Simplicity*: No complex tools or statistical analysis required
* *Team-Based Investigation*: Collaborative exploration of causal relationships
* *Avoiding Blame*: Focus on process failures, not individual fault
* *Countermeasure Identification*: Once root cause is found, design interventions

*Key Proponent*: Taiichi Ohno (Toyota Production System, 1950s)

*Historical Context*: Core tool in Lean Manufacturing and Toyota Production System (TPS), foundational to continuous improvement (Kaizen)

*When to Use*:

* Incident post-mortems in software/DevOps
* Debugging when surface fixes don't resolve the issue
* Process improvement initiatives
* Understanding recurring problems
* Quality defect analysis
* Any situation where symptoms are clear but causes are not

*Related Concepts*:

* Kaizen (continuous improvement)
* Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
* Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa) – complementary tool
* A3 Problem Solving (Toyota)
* DevOps post-mortem culture

*Pitfall to Avoid*:

* Stopping too early at a symptom rather than root cause
* Pursuing a single causal chain when multiple factors contribute (use Fishbone Diagram for complex causality)
* Blame-focused questioning rather than system-focused

*Example Application*:

----
Problem: Website is down
Why? → Database connection failed
Why? → Connection pool exhausted
Why? → Long-running queries not timing out
Why? → No query timeout configured
Why? → Default configuration was never reviewed for production
Root Cause: Configuration review process missing
Countermeasure: Establish pre-production configuration checklist
