Full Name:: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture according to Martin Fowler

Also known as:: Fowler patterns, PEAA patterns, Enterprise patterns

*Core Concepts*:

Domain Logic Patterns:: Transaction Script, Domain Model, Table Module, Service Layer

Data Source Architectural Patterns:: Table Data Gateway, Row Data Gateway, Active Record, Data Mapper

Object-Relational Behavioral Patterns:: Unit of Work, Identity Map, Lazy Load

Object-Relational Structural Patterns:: Identity Field, Foreign Key Mapping, Association Table Mapping, Dependent Mapping, Embedded Value, Serialized LOB, Single Table Inheritance, Class Table Inheritance, Concrete Table Inheritance

Object-Relational Metadata Mapping Patterns:: Metadata Mapping, Query Object, Repository

Web Presentation Patterns:: Model View Controller, Page Controller, Front Controller, Template View, Transform View, Two Step View, Application Controller

Distribution Patterns:: Remote Facade, Data Transfer Object

Offline Concurrency Patterns:: Optimistic Offline Lock, Pessimistic Offline Lock, Coarse-Grained Lock, Implicit Lock

Session State Patterns:: Client Session State, Server Session State, Database Session State

Base Patterns:: Gateway, Mapper, Layer Supertype, Separated Interface, Registry, Value Object, Money, Special Case, Plugin, Service Stub, Record Set


Key Proponent:: Martin Fowler ("Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture", 2002)

*When to Use*:

* Designing complex enterprise applications with data persistence
* Building layered architectures with clear separation of concerns
* Working with object-relational mapping and database interactions
* Designing web applications with proper presentation layer patterns
* Managing distributed system communication
* Handling concurrency in multi-user enterprise systems
* Creating maintainable and testable enterprise code

*Related Anchors*:

* <<domain-driven-design,Domain-Driven Design>> - Complements PEAA with domain modeling approach
* <<hexagonal-architecture,Hexagonal Architecture>> - Architectural style emphasizing ports and adapters
* <<clean-architecture,Clean Architecture>> - Layered architecture pattern with dependency rules
