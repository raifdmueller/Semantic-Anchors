====
*Also known as*: Ports and Adapters, Onion Architecture (variant)

*Core Concepts*:

* *Hexagonal structure*: Core domain at the center, isolated from external concerns
* *Ports*: Interfaces defining how the application communicates
* *Adapters*: Implementations that connect to external systems
* *Dependency inversion*: Dependencies point inward toward the domain
* *Technology independence*: Core logic doesn't depend on frameworks or infrastructure
* *Primary/Driving adapters*: User interfaces, APIs (inbound)
* *Secondary/Driven adapters*: Databases, message queues (outbound)
* *Testability*: Easy to test core logic in isolation
* *Symmetry*: All external interactions are treated uniformly

*Key Proponent*: Alistair Cockburn (2005)

*When to Use*:

* Applications requiring high testability
* Systems that need to support multiple interfaces (web, CLI, API)
* When you want to defer infrastructure decisions
* Microservices with clear domain boundaries
