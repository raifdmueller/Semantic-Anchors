Full Name:: IEC 61508 Safety Integrity Levels

Also known as:: Functional Safety Levels, SIL Classification

*Core Concepts*:

Four Safety Integrity Levels::
+
SIL 1 (lowest)::: 10^-2^ ≤ PFD < 10^-1^ (tolerable risk reduction)
SIL 2::: 10^-3^ ≤ PFD < 10^-2^ (moderate risk reduction)
SIL 3::: 10^-4^ ≤ PFD < 10^-3^ (substantial risk reduction)
SIL 4 (highest)::: 10^-5^ ≤ PFD < 10^-4^ (maximum risk reduction)

Risk-based classification:: SIL level determined by hazard analysis and risk assessment

Safety lifecycle:: Systematic approach from concept to decommissioning

Hardware requirements:: Architectural constraints and systematic capability

Software requirements:: Development methods, verification, and validation techniques

Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD):: Key metric for safety function reliability

Safety instrumented systems (SIS):: Protection layers implementing safety functions

Verification and validation:: Independent assessment of safety claims

Systematic failures:: Focus on preventing design and specification errors

Random hardware failures:: Statistical analysis and fault tolerance


Key Standard:: IEC 61508 "Functional Safety of Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic Safety-related Systems" (first edition 1998, second edition 2010)

*Related Standards*:
