Impacts:: How can actors' behavior change? (How?)

Deliverables:: What can we build? (What?)

Visual mapping:: Mind-map style collaborative diagram

Assumption testing:: Make assumptions explicit

Scope management:: Prevent scope creep by linking to goals

Roadmap alternative:: Goal-oriented rather than feature-oriented
