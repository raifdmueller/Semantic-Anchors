*Full Name*: Markdown Any Decision Records

*Core Concepts*:

* *Structured template*: Well-defined format with specific sections
* *Standard fields*:
** Title (short noun phrase)
** Status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
** Context and Problem Statement
** Decision Drivers (forces influencing the decision)
** Considered Options (alternatives evaluated)
** Decision Outcome (chosen option with justification)
** Pros and Cons of the Options (trade-off analysis)
** Links (related decisions, references)
* *Markdown format*: Uses standard Markdown for wide compatibility
* *Clear structure*: More detailed than basic ADRs, includes explicit alternatives
* *Trade-off documentation*: Explicitly captures pros/cons of each option
* *Version control*: Stored with code, immutable like other ADRs
* *Lightweight yet comprehensive*: Balances completeness with maintainability

*Key Proponents*: Oliver Kopp, Olaf Zimmermann (and MADR community)

*Reference*: https://adr.github.io/madr/

*When to Use*:

* When you need more structure than basic ADRs
* Projects requiring explicit documentation of alternatives
* Teams that need to justify decisions with detailed trade-offs
* Organizations using Markdown-based documentation workflows
* When LLM assistance is needed to generate consistent decision records
* Complementing arc42 Section 9 (Architecture Decisions)
