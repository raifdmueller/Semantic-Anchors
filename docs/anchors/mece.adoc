====
*Full Name*: MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

*Core Concepts*:

* *Mutually Exclusive*: Categories have no overlap - each item belongs to exactly one category
* *Collectively Exhaustive*: Categories cover all possibilities - nothing is left out
* *Framework for organization*: Systematic approach to structuring information and problems
* *Prevents duplication*: Mutual exclusivity ensures no redundant coverage
* *Prevents gaps*: Collective exhaustiveness ensures complete coverage
* *Clear boundaries*: Unambiguous categorization with well-defined criteria
* *Hierarchical application*: Can be applied recursively at multiple levels
* *Validation approach*: Check both dimensions independently (exclusivity and exhaustiveness)

*Key Proponent*: Barbara Minto (McKinsey & Company, late 1960s)

*When to Use*:

* Problem decomposition and analysis
* Software architecture and component design
* Module boundary definition to avoid overlapping responsibilities
* Requirements organization and breakdown
* API endpoint structure and design
* Decision tree construction
* Issue tree development
* Organizing complex information
* System design and modular architecture

*Related Concepts*:

* Foundational to the Pyramid Principle
* Supports Single Responsibility Principle
* Enables Separation of Concerns
* Used in logic trees and issue trees
