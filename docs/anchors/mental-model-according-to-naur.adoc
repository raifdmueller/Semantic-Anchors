= Mental Model according to Naur

[%collapsible]
====
*Full Name*: Programming as Theory Building (Mental Model) according to Peter Naur

*Core Concepts*:

* *Theory building*: Programming is creating a mental model, not just writing code
* *Theory of the program*: Deep understanding of why the program works and how it relates to the problem domain
* *Knowledge in people*: The real program exists in developers' minds, not in the code
* *Theory decay*: When original developers leave, the theory is lost
* *Documentation limitations*: Written documentation cannot fully capture the theory
* *Maintenance as theory*: Effective maintenance requires possessing the theory
* *Communication is key*: Theory must be shared through collaboration and conversation
* *Ramp-up time*: New team members need time to build the theory
* *Code as artifact*: Code is merely a representation of the underlying theory

*Key Proponent*: Peter Naur (Turing Award winner, 1978)

*Original Work*: "Programming as Theory Building" (1985)

*Application in Software Development*:

* Understanding why knowledge transfer is challenging
* Emphasizing pair programming and mob programming
* Justifying time for onboarding and code walkthroughs
* Explaining technical debt accumulation when teams change
* Supporting documentation practices that capture "why" not just "what"
* Advocating for team stability and continuity

*Contrast with Other Views*:

* Programming as text production → Focus on code output
* Programming as problem solving → Focus on algorithms
* Programming as theory building → Focus on understanding
