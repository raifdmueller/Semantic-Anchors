Full Name:: Morphological Analysis / Morphological Box (German: Morphologischer Kasten)

*Core Concepts*:

Multi-dimensional decomposition:: Break complex problem into independent parameters/dimensions

Variant enumeration:: Identify possible values/options for each parameter

Matrix construction:: Organize parameters and variants in table/box form

Combinatorial exploration:: Systematically examine combinations of variants

Constraint filtering:: Eliminate infeasible or contradictory combinations

Novel solution discovery:: Find non-obvious solutions through systematic recombination

Complete solution space:: Ensure all possibilities are considered

Structured creativity:: Systematic approach to innovation and ideation


Key Proponent:: Fritz Zwicky (1940s-1960s, California Institute of Technology)

Historical Context:: Developed for aerospace engineering problems (jet engines, spacecraft propulsion), now widely applied in product development, system design, and innovation management.

*When to Use*:

* Exploring design alternatives for complex systems
* Product feature combination analysis
* Technology selection with multiple dimensions
* Architecture decision-making with independent parameters
* Innovation workshops and ideation sessions
* Requirements engineering for product variants
* Solution space mapping before evaluation

*Example Application*:

----
Problem: Design a developer documentation system
Parameters:
├─ Format: Markdown, AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, API-first
├─ Hosting: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Read the Docs, S3+CloudFront
├─ Generator: Static (Hugo, Jekyll), Dynamic (Docusaurus), Custom
└─ Versioning: Git-based, Version selector, Branch-per-version

Matrix generates 4 × 4 × 3 × 3 = 144 possible combinations
Filter by constraints (e.g., "AsciiDoc + Hugo not well-supported")
→ Identify ~20 feasible solutions for evaluation with Pugh Matrix
----

*Related Concepts*:

* MECE Principle (for parameter independence)
* Pugh Matrix (for evaluating generated alternatives)
* Design of Experiments (DOE)
* Combinatorial design
* Solution space exploration

*Complementary Tools*:

* Use *Morphological Box* to generate alternatives
* Then apply *Pugh Matrix* to evaluate and select best option
* Use *MECE* to ensure parameter independence

*Pitfalls to Avoid*:

* Parameters that are not independent (violates combinatorial logic)
* Too many parameters leading to combinatorial explosion
* Stopping at matrix creation without exploring combinations
* Forgetting to filter out infeasible combinations
