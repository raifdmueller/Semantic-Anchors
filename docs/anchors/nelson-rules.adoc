*Full Name*: Nelson Rules (Tests for Special Causes)

*Core Concepts*:

* *8 rules* for detecting non-random patterns in Control Charts
* *Rule 1*: One point beyond 3σ (Outlier)
* *Rule 2*: 9 consecutive points on the same side of the mean (Shift/Bias)
* *Rule 3*: 6 consecutive points steadily increasing or decreasing (Trend)
* *Rule 4*: 14 points alternating up and down (Oscillation)
* *Rule 5*: 2 out of 3 points beyond 2σ on the same side
* *Rule 6*: 4 out of 5 points beyond 1σ on the same side
* *Rule 7*: 15 points within 1σ (suspiciously low variance)
* *Rule 8*: 8 points outside ±1σ, but none beyond ±3σ (systematic oscillation)
* *Common Cause vs. Special Cause*: Distinguishing inherent from assignable variation
* *Zones A/B/C*: Dividing the Control Chart into 6 zones (each 1σ wide)
* *False Positive Trade-off*: More active rules = higher sensitivity, but more false alarms

*Key Proponent*: Lloyd S. Nelson (1984, Journal of Quality Technology)

*Relationship to Other Anchors*:

* *Control Chart (Shewhart)*: Nelson Rules are applied to Control Charts
* *<<spc,SPC>>*: Nelson Rules are a tool within Statistical Process Control
* *Western Electric Rules*: Predecessor; Nelson Rules extend these with Rules 5-8

*When to Use*:

* Detecting non-random patterns in time series data
* Process monitoring in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare
* Potential application in IT monitoring (memory leaks, performance degradation)
* Quality assurance in Six Sigma / DMAIC Control Phase
