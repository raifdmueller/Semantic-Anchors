*Full Name*: Pugh Decision Matrix (also Pugh Controlled Convergence)

*Core Concepts*:

* *Baseline comparison*: Compare alternatives against a reference solution
* *Criteria weighting*: Assign importance to evaluation criteria
* *Relative scoring*: Better (+), Same (S), Worse (-) than baseline
* *Structured evaluation*: Systematic comparison across multiple dimensions
* *Iterative refinement*: Multiple rounds to converge on best solution
* *Team decision-making*: Facilitates group consensus
* *Hybrid solutions*: Combine strengths of different alternatives

*Key Proponent*: Stuart Pugh

*When to Use*:

* Multiple viable alternatives exist
* Decision criteria are known but trade-offs are unclear
* Team needs to reach consensus
* Architecture or technology selection decisions
