*Full Name*: SOLID Object-Oriented Design Principles

*Core Concepts*:

* *Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)*: Each class should have one responsibility
* *Open/Closed Principle (OCP)*: Entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
* *Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)*: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
* *Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)*: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
* *Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)*: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations

*Key Proponent*: Robert C. Martin ("Uncle Bob")

*When to Use*:

* Designing maintainable and scalable object-oriented systems
* Refactoring legacy code to improve structure
* Building systems where flexibility and testability are important
* Teaching or enforcing good software design practices
