*Full Name*: Statistical Process Control

*Core Concepts*:

* *Process monitoring*: Systematic statistical monitoring of running processes
* *Common Cause Variation*: Inherent, random fluctuation — stable and predictable
* *Special Cause Variation*: Assignable cause — unstable, correctable
* *Control Charts*: Central visual tool (see dedicated anchor)
* *Detection rules*: Nelson Rules, Western Electric Rules (see dedicated anchors)
* *Process Capability*: Indices Cp, Cpk (short-term) and Pp, Ppk (long-term)
* *In-Control*: Process exhibits only Common Cause Variation
* *Out-of-Control*: Special Cause detected — intervention required
* *Continuous Improvement*: SPC as a foundation for ongoing process improvement
* *DMAIC Control Phase*: SPC tools secure improvements within Six Sigma

*Key Proponents*: Walter A. Shewhart (founder), W. Edwards Deming (dissemination), Western Electric Company

*Relationship to Other Anchors*:

* *Control Chart (Shewhart)*: Central tool within SPC
* *Nelson Rules*: Detection rules for Special Causes on Control Charts
* *Six Sigma*: Uses SPC particularly in the Control phase
* *Testing Pyramid*: Conceptual parallel — different levels of quality assurance

*When to Use*:

* Monitoring manufacturing and business processes
* Quality management per ISO 9001, IATF 16949, Six Sigma
* Pharmaceutical Continuous Process Verification (CPV)
* Conceptual foundation for anomaly detection in IT systems
* When the question is: "Is my process stable, or has something changed?"
