:categories: uncategorized

[%collapsible]
====
*Full Name*: Single Point of Truth

*Core Concepts*:

* *Implementation pattern*: Focuses on where and how data/logic is stored and accessed
* *Centralized location*: Each piece of information resides in exactly one place
* *Reference relationships*: Other locations reference the single point rather than duplicate it
* *Data consistency*: Eliminates synchronization issues and conflicting data
* *Update propagation*: Changes at the single point automatically affect all references
* *Clear ownership*: Explicit responsibility for maintaining each piece of truth
* *Code-level practice*: Applied at the code and system design level

*When to Use*:

* Implementing functions and utilities to avoid code duplication
* Database schema design to eliminate redundant data
* Configuration management across distributed systems
* State management in applications
* API design where data flows from a single endpoint

*Difference from SSOT*: SPOT emphasizes the implementation detail of where data lives, while SSOT emphasizes the authoritative, trusted nature of that data source

*Related Concepts*: DRY, SSOT, Normalized databases, Master data management
