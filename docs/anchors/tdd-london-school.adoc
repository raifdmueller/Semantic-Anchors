====
*Also known as*: Mockist TDD, Outside-In TDD

*Core Concepts*:

* *Mock-heavy testing*: Heavy use of test doubles (mocks, stubs) to isolate units
* *Outside-in development*: Start from the outermost layers (UI, API) and work inward
* *Interaction-based testing*: Focus on verifying interactions between objects
* *Behavior verification*: Test how objects collaborate rather than state
* *Interface discovery*: Use tests to discover and define interfaces
* *Walking skeleton*: Build end-to-end functionality early, then fill in details

*Key Proponents*: Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce ("Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests")

*When to Use*:

* Complex systems with many collaborating objects
* When designing APIs and interfaces
* Distributed systems where integration is costly
