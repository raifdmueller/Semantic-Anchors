====
Full Name:: Testing Pyramid according to Mike Cohn

*Core Concepts*:

Three layers::
* *Unit tests* (base): Many fast, isolated tests
* *Integration tests* (middle): Moderate number, test component interaction
* *End-to-end tests* (top): Few, test complete user journeys

Proportional distribution:: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests

Cost and speed:: Unit tests cheap and fast, E2E tests expensive and slow

Feedback loops:: Faster feedback from lower levels

Anti-pattern: Ice cream cone:: Too many E2E tests, too few unit tests

Test at the right level:: Don't test through UI what can be tested in isolation

Confidence gradient:: Balance confidence with execution speed


Key Proponent:: Mike Cohn ("Succeeding with Agile", 2009)

*When to Use*:

* Planning test strategy for projects
* Balancing test types in CI/CD pipelines
* Evaluating existing test suites
* Guiding team testing practices
