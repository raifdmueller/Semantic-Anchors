Full Name:: There Is More Than One Way To Do It

Also known as:: Tim Toady

*Core Concepts*:

Multiple valid approaches:: Acknowledges that problems can be solved in different, equally valid ways

Developer freedom:: Trust developers to choose the right approach for their context

Expressiveness:: Languages and tools should support diverse problem-solving styles

Context-dependent decisions:: The "best" solution depends on constraints, team, and situation

No single canonical form:: Resist dogma — flexibility over prescription

Trade-off awareness:: Different approaches have different trade-offs; none is universally superior

Pragmatism over purity:: Practical results matter more than theoretical elegance

Collaborative decision-making:: When working with others, discuss approach rather than assume


Key Proponent:: Larry Wall (Perl programming language)

*Contrast*:

* Python's Zen: "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it" (opposite philosophy)
* TIMTOWTDI favors flexibility and expressiveness over enforced uniformity

*When to Use*:

* Choosing between multiple valid architectural or design approaches
* Code reviews where different styles achieve the same goal
* Team discussions about tooling, frameworks, or methodologies
* LLM-assisted development: ask for alternatives rather than accepting the first suggestion
* Avoiding premature standardization before understanding trade-offs
* Resisting "one true way" dogma in technology choices
* Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): documenting why one approach was chosen over other valid alternatives
* KonsenT-based decisions: finding solutions with no objections rather than forcing one "right" way
