Full Name:: todo.txt-flavoured Markdown Task Lists

Also known as:: Enhanced Markdown Tasks, Markdown with todo.txt conventions

*Core Concepts*:

Markdown task lists:: Standard GitHub-flavoured markdown syntax (`- [ ]` uncompleted, `- [x]` completed)

Priority markers:: Uses todo.txt priority notation `(A)`, `(B)`, `(C)` where `(A)` is highest priority

Project tags:: Prefixed with `+` to group related tasks (e.g., `+website`, `+semantic-anchors`)

Context tags:: Prefixed with `@` to indicate location/tool/context (e.g., `@computer`, `@home`, `@research`)

Key-value metadata:: Structured data pairs like `due:YYYY-MM-DD`, `priority:high`, or custom fields

Date tracking:: Creation dates and completion dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

Human readability:: Plain text format that remains readable without special tools

Tool-agnostic:: Can be processed by both markdown renderers and todo.txt tools

Searchable and filterable:: Easy to grep/search by tags, priorities, or metadata


*Pattern Structure*:

[source,markdown]
----
- [ ] (Priority) Task description +project @context key:value
- [x] YYYY-MM-DD (Priority) Completed task +project
----

*Example Usage*:
