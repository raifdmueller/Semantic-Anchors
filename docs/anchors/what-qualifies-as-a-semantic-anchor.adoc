=== What Qualifies as a Semantic Anchor

A term qualifies as a semantic anchor when it activates a rich, well-defined conceptual framework in the LLM's training data. The key differentiator is *definition depth* – not whether the anchor is about domain knowledge or interaction patterns.

A good semantic anchor is:

* *Precise*: It references a specific, established body of knowledge or methodology with clear boundaries
* *Rich*: It activates multiple interconnected concepts, not just a single instruction or directive
* *Consistent*: Different users invoking it will get similar conceptual activation across contexts
* *Attributable*: It can be traced to key proponents, publications, established practices, or documented standards


Semantic anchors exist on a spectrum from domain-heavy to interaction-heavy:

----
Domain-heavy ◄──────────────────────► Interaction-heavy
   arc42          Pyramid Principle        Socratic Method
   SOLID          Rubber Duck Debugging    BLUF
   DDD            Five Whys                Chain of Thought
----

The distinction isn't a strict category but rather a matter of emphasis. Most anchors have *both* dimensions:

* *Pyramid Principle*: Domain knowledge about structured communication + behavior change in how output is structured
* *TDD, London School*: Domain knowledge about testing + behavior change in how code is written
* *Socratic Method*: Interaction pattern for dialogue + domain knowledge from philosophical tradition

The quality bar is the same across this spectrum – all anchors must be well-defined, rich, and activatable.

==== Counter-Examples

Well-known terms that are *not* semantic anchors because they lack definition depth:

* *"TLDR"*: Underspecified, no defined structure or methodology, vague instruction to "be short"
* *"ELI5"*: Vague target level, no pedagogical framework, no consistent interpretation
* *"Keep it short"*: Pure instruction, no conceptual depth or established methodology
* *"Make it simple"*: Ambiguous directive without reference to specific simplification frameworks

These terms may be useful in conversation, but they don't activate rich conceptual frameworks the way true semantic anchors do.


Below is a curated list of semantic anchors useful for software development, architecture, and requirements engineering. Each anchor includes related concepts and practices.
